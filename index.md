# Hello in Github Page!

This is a web representation of my studying/understanding on subjects related to Britain (the UK), such as history and English language. Much of the contents are from Wikipedia, with my intensive complication and visualization. The goal is to accelerate  readers' learning in such seemingly fimiliar but complicated subjects.

This tries to be, at current stage, bi·lin·gual, of Chinese and English. There is always advantage/insight from different aspect of culture background to look at the same thing.
